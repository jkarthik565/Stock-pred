Total paper loss of $1.3 million on my $TSLA shares today! 
Back in the days, when Tesla was struggling, especially during the Model 3 ramp, Tesla stock would sell off like today, but much harder. 📉

What did/do you guys do during times like this?💡 

Me: I concentrate my positions, buy the dip, listen to music &amp; workout a lot.

$TSLA and $TWTR stocks now inexorably linked. @elonmusk
 https://t.co/8AIiBrHNLZ 
$TSLA into close broke below 887 which was a key level I gave a month ago or so. It was extremely important because it confirmed that $TSLA's bounce from 697 on Feb 24 was corrective and therefore we should expect to break below that low. Now the 600s are a realistic target🤝 https://t.co/DnCGLT15YJ 
I actually want Elon to leverage his shares as much as he can, in order to buy Twitter. 

It would incentivize him to keep $TSLA high. 

Plus selling before 1/a stock split, 2/ investment grade upgrade, and 3/ massive scaling in Q3, Q4 would be quite dumb. 
Lots of fintwit hate for @BillGates but he crushed that $tsla short didn’t he? 
I had 3 Macallan 25 single malt neat (2 shots each), a small snifter of RVW 25 (Don't do this often as it's about 2,000/shot and a beer chaser. To say I'm slightly inebriated is an understatement. I'll be passed out in about 20 min. $TSLA https://t.co/F9bZHFkyxK 
Down $2.4M today.  Not feeling sad even a little. 
 Short-term, it's a slot machine.  People panic sell and buy.  Long-term, Tesla is as solid a company as ever.  $TSLA 📈💎🪑💯 
Fun fact: @BillGates made $69M on his $TSLA short today.

What news dropped?! 🤩 
Hey, look at the bright side. At least $TSLA didn’t miss earnings. Now that would have been something… 
There have only been 5 days with over 40 million shares of $TSLA trades this year. 
-3 late January selling panic
-1 Feb 24 start of war 
-and today.

Maybe @elonmusk IS liquidating some. Twice the average volume over the last month. 
$TSLA gains got me being upper class one tax year and poverty the next.

@elonmusk needs to raise $21B for Twitter deal yet his personal share in $TSLA lost over $22B today. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this deal is terrible for Elon and $TSLA shareholders. Markets showed the impact today. 
BREAKING: $TWTR deal to be done within 6 months. Either Twitter or Elon can walk with $1B fee. 

Just walk @elonmusk. Pay the Billion. This sh!tty deal costs $TSLA shareholders $140B in valuation (just today). Is it really worth it? 
I didn’t retire by age 31 by listening to $TSLAQ fuckboys. 

I retired by going with my research, conviction, product knowledge, understanding and believing Elon, and having a grip of what’s happening inside $TSLA. 

Let me tell you, it’s going fuckin great. 

Ignore the FUD! ❌ 
Going to go drink. See you all tomorrow. $TSLA https://t.co/N8AgqECeNH 
Today, April 26, 2022. A day that will go down in infamy. $TSLA stock was suddenly and deliberately attacked by market manipulators of Wall Street. 
Tesla, $TSLA, shares fell by more than 12% today, or about a $21 billion paper personal loss for Musk, as per Axios.

This, incidentally, is about same amount he's personally committing to the Twitter, $TWTR, deal. 
$TSLA now trades at 75x Q1’22 annualized EPS ($860 / $2.86 GAAP EPS x 4)

That’s w/o factoring in uplift from 2 new GFs (annualized EPS assumes Tesla does not grow Q-o-Q)

Compare the $11.44 in 2022 vs the $4.90 GAAP EPS in 2021 (133% growth)

P/L: -$48.2K 👎 Tough day.  Yes everything was an obvious short but again no real major pops to get in made it difficult to get in short comfortably.

If you’re panicking about your $TSLA position, you should probably spend more time researching Tesla. The more you know, the easier it is to hold. 
I'm going to reread tesla's earnings report, who cares if Elon has to sell some stock, that means more for us... I don't think he is going to sell his tesla stock to finance twitter, but certainly use it as collateral. $TSLA 
One week ago $TSLA hit $1,077. Today we closed at $876. Ask yourself - has anything changed between then and now that rationally describes this move?

Guys, calm down. I'm still a long term bull on $TSLA and still think it will recover eventually. However, Elon buying Twitter was the dumbest move and even experts think it was odd and dumb. The stock today proved me correct. 
Today was brutal. Paper loss of over $300k $TSLA 
Was today the single biggest valuation drop in $TSLA history? 
The nonsense and conjecture around tesla have become silly.  Tesla under $1000. Gift. $tsla

Market is trashing all tech stocks not just $TSLA. But it’s fair to say investors are worried $TWTR deal won’t be completed if TSLA stock falls too much. @elonmusk can squash the selling pressure simply by saying he doesn’t intend to sell any TSLA shares to pay for his TWTR deal.

Elon's purchase of Twitter may go down as the worst decision he made in the history of his and $TSLA's success. 
With $TSLA down 11% today this Tweet was very prescient. But this drop is just the beginning. The stock may bounce, but that's just another opportunity to sell. The $TWTR buy is a gift to the shorts. They smell blood and are on the attack. 
Tesla market cap is down today by more than twice the amount of money Elon Musk paid for Twitter.

A totally ridiculous sell-off in $tsla today, driven by emotion and certainly accelerated by short-sellers to profit from it

Emotional sell-offs in fundamentally strong and undervalued stocks are great buying opportunities 
The lower $TSLA goes, the stronger my conviction gets. 
$TSLA investors: 
- plays with $500k of $TSLA like nothing,
- see a shirt for $20 and be like "nah, too expensive" 
Tesla PE now 75 based on $12 earnings estimates for 2022. $TSLA 
$TSLA at new lows as markets somewhat recover. 
Extreme fear!

If $GOOGL &amp; $MSFT ERs come out more like $TSLA's, not $NFLX's, we should see a big reverse tmrw. 
Simple math for the dumb nuts out there. 

Take Q1 2022 earnings, divide it by today’s stock price. 

You’ll get a PE ~69. 

This is massively cheap for a company growing +60% per year for many years to come. 

Stay level headed!

IMHO $TSLA falling on trader /shorts speculation fueled by the media that Elon will have to sell some TSLA shares to come up with $21B equity for $TWTR deal since he gave no detail on how he would raise the $21B in his revised 13D filing last night. Doesn’t make it true. https://t.co/U6wWHCCr46

I could wonder if this sell-off today was also intentional. I mean, Elon is at lest risk when $TSLA sold off once financing is secured. So, why not cause the sell-off first to limit the risk and have better chance to send it higher when that risk is removed. Speculation but hmmm. 
Now people know why I get so pissed about $TSLA. I mean how many times have we gone up only to come down further. How many times can get get great news and earnings only to have it chopped again. It's a vicious cycle and irritating that it can't be an "investment" these days. 
Elon buys $TWTR for $44B, the next day $TSLA loses $105B in market-cap...🤯

$TSLA volatility is the gift that keeps on giving for those who know what to do.

If you want to build a sizable long-term position, you need patience and the fortitude to act when there's major pessimism. I see way too many people showing off their buys during euphoric highs. 
Now that I think about it, buying $TWTR was that magic trigger all bears craved for years for a down 10% $TSLA day, but they were all looking at car sales…and margins…and all sort of irrelevant stuff..

Once again, $TSLA is the equity options market. https://t.co/L9LYCnE3cj 
Remember when (last year) the NASDAQ would shed 400 points over the course of maybe 2 months or so. Now, it does it in just hours. The volatility is insane recently. Down shed 2,000 points in 3 sessions. It sometimes took a year to do that before. $TSLA 
Did anyone think after the incredible earnings from $TSLA we'd be at $900 today? Shocking. Even with macro it's shocking. 
$TSLA literally destroyed earnings estimates, and now it’s down 15%. It’s P/E is gonna be under 100, for a company growing at 50%. If this ain’t a buying opportunity, then I know nothing about investing. 
I believe that ultimately $TSLA will be valued on its strong earnings &amp; unparalleled growth prospects

I also think that Elon is smart enough to invite other investors in to help fund the $20B of equity needed so he didn't have to take on all the risk himself and put his $TSLA shares at higher risk. There are many unanswered questions. Hopefully we find out details soon. 
Tesla is now trading at 79x annualized Q1 earnings. $TSLA 
Me not adding $TSLA puts today https://t.co/eIzPm7ue2s 
If Elon Musk is selling $TSLA shares, that means Gary Black adds an "Elon Musk stops selling Tesla shares" as a new catalyst shortly. 
I don't know what is causing this sell off. Yes, the macro is getting fuc!ed today as is all tech. But it's suspect with the volume sells at the open and the continued sell on high volume. $TSLA doesn't just lose 9.5% for no reason. I hope he wasn't selling. We'll know in 2 days. 
This selling off of $TSLA is pretty silly. I'm buying the $904. Screw it. Go big or go home. 
@shaunking @Tesla @elonmusk Elon would like to thank you for using his platform. Have a great day!

@shaunking @elonmusk @Tesla Shaun, thanks for a morning of laughs without the two drink minimum. 
WHAT IS THE SAFE WORD?! 🛑 ✋ 
$TSLA 
BUT - Tesla's own rules on director/officer share pledges is actually stricter and imposes its own max level at 25% LTV. (Below is from the 2021 proxy statement). 

Under this requirement only a 20% decrease in $TSLA price would trigger a call. Much smaller cushion https://t.co/ltGdWi1V20 
Interesting tidbits on the Musk margin loan... The terms of the margin loan are 20% initial LTV with a 35% margin call level. This means that for a $12.5B loan, Musk must pledge $62.5B worth of $TSLA based on share price at closing, and gets called if TSLA drops ~43%. 
It’s what you do during times of panic that will determine how strong your seeds grow when the sun comes out.

@shaunking @elonmusk @Tesla Trying hard there, mate. Just reach a little…bit…further… 
This could get interesting if $TSLA keeps falling. Musk is taking on a lot of margin debt to push this deal through and the cushion is already thinning. 
I doubt Elon would sell $tsla in the same haphazard manner he did last time - he would sell via block trade through MS since he’s paying them already. I also doubt Elon would sell before he has to (at least wait until after 10:1 split). Deal won’t close for several months. $twtr

Bought some at $944's. What the hell. $TSLA 
WTF just happened to $TSLA? https://t.co/1Bj0vnZveW 
This action looks just like when Elon was selling last time. $TSLA 
Maybe we should all go back to bed. 📉

Did Elon start selling already? Geez. $TSLA 
Musk has agreed to take out a $12.5 billion margin loan, secured against his stock of Tesla, $TSLA, to pay for some of the $33.5 billion equity check for Twitter, $TWTR.

If Tesla’s stock to drop by 40%, he would have to repay that loan, a regulatory filing has shown. 
This Twitter deal will wipe Musk out.

He's borrowing HEAVILY in LTV terms against $TSLA stock that will literally be down 95% before this bear market is over (and, at $50/share/$55 billion the company would STILL be grossly overvalued).

He's DONE, slow-motion train wreck style. 
I don't own a @Tesla yet @elonmusk , but my golf cart is electric..... Baby steps... https://t.co/R1zoFU0uMA 
@squawksquare The deadline for companies on a 12/31 calendar year to file 2022 proxy statements is Mon 5/2/2022. While that can be extended, the TWTR purchase now offers an incentive for Elon to keep TSLA stock price high for the margin loan and equity piece if he decides to sell $TSLA shares. 
Many rumors floating around the $TSLA space this morning signaling a 20:1 stock split coming. Pure speculation but I would love to see a 20:1 as stated when I heard the news. 
All this talk about Elon &amp; Twitter has been fun but can we get back to talking about just how unbelievable Q3/Q4 will be &amp; how $TSLA will at least double from where it is today by then? 😊 
A reminder that the Cybercuck was revealed on Nov 21, 2019, 887 days ago.

Total cumulative Cybercuck production: 0.

"Where's the competition? Where's the competition?" bleat the Teslemming sheeple.

Now that we know more of the details of Elon's loan (not sale of any $TSLA shares), we may see Elon do whatever he can to keep shares of Tesla above $1,000 or send it even higher to never have to worry about the bank selling a single share in future. Would be last thing he'd want 
Let's make some money! $TSLA 
Fun read. Strong opening, clear demonstration of Elon's character, values and belief in a democratic process. A great peek behind the scenes.

$TSLA $TWTR #ElonMusk https://t.co/xcMZFYXX1s 
Check out the terms of Mr. Fraudsperger's margin loan...

If I'm reading this right, he must initially pledge $TSLA shares equal to 5x the loan value! That shows you how much confidence Jonas's employer has in his bulllshit price target, lol... https://t.co/BJ8C4voKEB 
Yesterday's and today's pre-market $tsla moves prove that all those speculating that a takeover by Elon Musk of Twitter will have a negative impact on the Tesla stock are wrong 
$TSLA +0.5% to $1,003 pre-mkt.  Equities wavered (SPX -0.2%, NDX -0.1%) after China’s central bank pledged to support China’s Covid-ravaged economy with easier monetary policy. 10yrTY -3.2bp to 2.787%. Earnings focus today with $GOOG and $MSFT reporting after the close. 
The $21B question:  Where will @elonmusk get the $21B equity cash needed to complete the $TWTR purchase?  Three options: 1/ equity investors (including public shareholders who want to roll); 2/ Selling down stakes in $TSLA or SpaceX; 3/ Other liquid assets - #BTC, Ethereum, cash https://t.co/zyA5H3ZX6F 
Interesting comments by @nitin_gadkari at the @raisinadialogue on Tesla. Don’t get me wrong, I like @elonmusk I think he is the man our times need, especially with @spacex but I don’t think @Tesla is the solution we need. 
Proactive braking before a speed sign. Somehow it only works there. You can see the car slowing down prior to reaching the 30 kph sign.
Limit at this point is still displayed as 50 kph, speed set to 55 kph.
@Tesla @elonmusk that's how it should be everywhere! https://t.co/jP9q9bh5mh 
It happened! @elonmusk, has purchased $TWTR at $44 billion! Shares of $TWTR closed 5.66% higher yesterday, while $TSLA remained flat. @WellsFargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald reiterated a Hold rating on it but lifted the PT to $54.2 (4.84% upside potential). https://t.co/0g7aYSPrSC https://t.co/28nqzRYVbr 
Bought more $TSLA today @ open for ~$979.

I always do my best to act with my future self in mind.

I have a great sense of urgency in my acquisition of $TSLA stock.

Tesla ~$1 Trillion will seem like a joke 10-15 years from now IMO. 
GADKARI INVITES MUSK! 

“Elon Musk can sell Tesla in India, if he makes in India”

“Don’t want Elon to make in China, and sell in India”

“We have all the competencies for @Tesla to produce in India”

“Request @elonmusk to come, Make in India”

@nitin_gadkari says to @ShereenBhan 
.@nitin_gadkari to @elonmusk (about reducing duties on @Tesla
imports to India) -

You are welcome to manufacture in India. We have vendors, infra, ports (to export)...Indian market is huge.

But manufacturing in China and selling in India is not a great proposition for us. https://t.co/cmbLZxplLe

imagine how many $TSLA shares you will have if 20:1 happens? mind blowing! and that value gets 10x very soon after split.

•
@elonmusk is $TWTR private at $54 a share this will keep the share price in the 48-53 range until the company goes private🔒
•
In the mean time you will likely hear analysts saying Elon won’t have time for $TSLA causing it to stall🚘
