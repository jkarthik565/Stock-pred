People be talking about how environmentally friendly $TSLA is while simply walking instead of driving saves the planet.

Few understand this. 
$TSLA cult bulls are conspicuously absent when TSLA trades 899 and abnormally loud 🔊 at 1200 

Not sure they are very reliable 
When you short $TSLA and it prints 14% gain in a single trading day .@smartertrader https://t.co/uaWjLYBkJO 
Not a lot of people understand nor will ever get the chance to ever feel a 8 figure gain in a single day. 

It takes guts, discipline, hard research, and conviction to get here, really do it, feel it, and realize it.

BREAKING: My sources have told me we can expect HUGE announcement by end of week from @elonmusk regarding #GigaTexas $TSLA 🚀🌙 https://t.co/ahOm7lCgif 
The question you must ask is who’s buying $TSLA here 1200?

Were the institutions sleeping at 600, at 899?

Did they not have their spies 🕵️‍♀️ at Fremont factory seeing trucks full of cars 🚗 leaving the plant?

So it’s not them buying here ok

It’s you . It’s you who’s buying 1200 
$TSLA That's how you start the new year! ATH here we come? 🤔 https://t.co/uoneY7mEMa 
$TSLA added around $130 billion to their market cap today… $EGC only added $100 million… must work harder 🥲 
@p_ferragu MS are very slow moving.

Expect an upgrade from Jonas &amp; co AFTER Q4 earnings.

$TSLA 
Can $TSLA 3000 trade? 

Yes it will trade. 

But it won’t get there the way you imagine it will 1200 to 3000. 

On the way it will encounter 865, it may encounter 600, it will encounter blood 🩸 

Will every one have stomach for this move from 1200 to 3000? 

No.

Seriously. There are so many low volatility assets that are actually extremely fragile and susceptible to negative black swans and/or disruption. Low volatility, but high long term risk.

Meanwhile $TSLA is ridiculously volatile but is low risk long term imho. https://t.co/7rPN06BH07

Just 9 days ago on 12/21 $TSLA bottomed at $886, in the midst of Elon selling. But those paying attention knew the selling would soon end, and there were strong odds of huge deliveries just around the corner. Since then, $TSLA has rallied +35% to today's close at $1200.

As for valuation, they tend to be expensive but to quite varying degrees. Exactly how expensive depends on the specific metric. 

For example with EV/EBITDA, they range from 16x for $FB to 143x for $TSLA.  

For price/sales, they range from under 4x for $AMZN to 30x for $TSLA. https://t.co/gmLgFPs6oI

Winning today.
I had to sell some $TSLA, and I had initially set a limit of 1100 on Friday, increased it to 1111 during the day. Yesterday I had a long chat with my wife about it and she said her gut feeling was to up the limit to 1200.
It was a nail biter.
Sold for 1200 
Elon would build cars for the nazis if we lived during world war 2. Of this I have no doubt

The little AH's pop is MM's closing the options on the $1,200. Just be careful as it may look appetizing but the MM's don't work for retail. $TSLA

$600,000+ Day To Finish🙏 $TSLA https://t.co/qgDZnGp2DB 
Just remember what I always say about Tuesday's. They typically create a dip buy opportunity. I'd expect the same tomorrow especially after a massive $146 pop. Now, $TSLA can do opposite of what is expected but just buy the dips and you'll be happy. 
$TSLA up over 13% today! WOW!

Like I said, $TSLA stonk ain't about deliveries or any other funnymentals. It's all about the calls. Shares will defy gravity so long as options continue wagging the dog of the share price. No one can tell you when this ends, but we all know how it ends. https://t.co/YiFsevUimB

People still have no idea why I do this. I do it occasionally when I think I can get a quick $10 dip. Not because I'm a clown or dumb. I know never to short $TSLA. I do it to try to make a quick buck and always donate every short dollar made to a charity. 
The market is gunnin for $1200 whether you like it or not. 📈

Here’s why TSLA stock is EXPLODING (Ep. 485)

https://t.co/y8jciy6kfR 
With $TSLA currently up +$130/shr, we are on track for the largest single-day absolute gain in $TSLA stock price history, with the previous largest gain being +$115/shr on Oct 25, 2021. 👏👏😎 
If we end up getting a major #lithium and #graphene merger with $IGEX With how much these resources are needed with $TSLA ect, I will head down to their office for interviews etc., it’s about 15 minutes from me in the tech center, which is an awesome place https://t.co/Lr1TosHjgH 
Apple's idea of innovation is improving a camera and adding colors every 12 months. If $AAPL is worth $3T, what's $TSLA worth?

Look at $TSLA's ambitions and plans. If they only accomplish 25% of them, it's worth a multiple of $AAPL. 
I’m not selling covered calls until I see $1300+. When I see $1300+, I will not sell strikes lower than $1500. $TSLA

Actually figure out how to trade $TSLA.

For some reason, I have always sucked at trading it. Gonna keep it super small as I learn the personality better. 
Tesla Q4 is not only about good results, it is the utter demonstration of Tesla execution under any circumstances. It is quite scary for an incumbent OEM. It must feel like being a barbarian tribe facing the mighty Roman Army. $tsla @elonmusk

20 minutes into my first class of the year and Elon and Tesla have already been brought up 🤩

Tesla gets talked about a lot in business school $TSLA 
I think Elon has made about $30 billion today so far, in one day. Wonder if he'll remind us about it as much as he talked about his 2021 $11 billion tax bill? $TSLA 
$AAPL setting up for 188-193 if it closes through the all time high at 182 this week

Sold my other 3,500 shares at $1174 for a $353,500 profit. I know. People will say I'm crazy. My bullishness doesn't change. When I see 10-year climbing fast and a 11% gain in 1 day, it's prudent to take some profits. I may miss some upside but that's okay. I know my risks. $TSLA 
At this rate $TSLA will break all-time highs by ...

I’m not into predicting $TSLA short term moves. But my tea leaves see a not inconsequential probability of a 50% move higher (from $1050) to nearly $1600 in the next 15-20 trading days.

Using MS as a proxy, 2022-2023 $TSLA EPS ests could increase ~20%. Adam Jonas of MS raised 2022 GAAP EPS from $5.99 to $7.89, and 2023 from $8.33 to $10.15.  Adding $2/sh for Non-GAAP EPS implies a 2022 raise of +24%, a 2023 raise of +18%. My $tsla ests are 2022 $12, 2023 $19. https://t.co/lrPV47NO5b https://t.co/M2dwVXd1UC

Did you see what CNBC is doing to $TSLA now? They're talking about guidance now needing to be 2 Million for 2022. Why you ask? Well, because they can now say  "expectations were 2 million" &amp; if Elon now guides under that, they'll produce all kinds of headlines saying demand weak. 
$LCID trading with $TSLA

$TSLA setting up to test 1200 next, still looks fine as long as 1128 holds this week

I smell $1200 for $TSLA today, who's with me?! 🎉🚀🌙

“Can Tesla do 2mm units in 2022? At this point we’d still describe 2mm as a stretch target but one that looks far more realistic following 4Q deliveries.” https://t.co/WUzv5gDgK3 
Okay I need to do something productive besides stare at $TSLA all day.

If you are holding this week calls remember not to go crazy sizing, they will lose Theta Quick if any sideways or chop after morning Euphoria. #tradingtips 
Oversizing on Option Weeklies is quickest way to lose account. 
This shows EV adoption by geographic segment.  China clearly leading the charge with Europe close behind.  The $8K EV credit in the BBB would hopefully allow US to close some of the gap. @Lebeaucarnews @CNBCnow @SquawkStreet $tsla https://t.co/Utq7wsbj4E 
@TeslaPodcast $TSLA is the easiest company to invest in.

1. Listen to what the board &amp; CFO say and adjust up to account for sandbagging.

2. Listen to what the CEO says and adjust time expectations to Elon time to account for exuberance.

3. Trust the data 
CNBC @Lebeaucarnews has no idea what he’s talking about when it comes to EV adoption.  EV sales will be up ~100% in 2021 and are likely to rise another 60% in 2022.  In a word, global EV sales are exploding. That dynamic is what’s driving $tsla volumes to the moon. https://t.co/9K1nJt51Y9 
Today is going to be an amazing day to watch $TSLA. 🤗 
Quarter after quarter, a little bit of doubt about Tesla's 20M vehicle per year target goes away $TSLA 
@JilianneParker @Tesla you’re right, I am not technologically savvy

existing options positions indicate a gamma squeeze if stock is &gt;1115
If it can push towards 1175 it seems that the gamma tied to 1200c could unlock another leg up

NEWS: $TSLA now up 10% on the day after reporting record vehicle deliveries. https://t.co/mpbvHjpFWA 
2/ I will revisit my $TSLA PT Of $1,400 over the next week. My PT is based on my 2022-205 volume/EPS forecasts, which are way above Street #.  My 2025 EPS of $40 compares to 2025 Street EPS of $18, so far less upside for me.  WS will spend today revising 4Q and FY’22 Vol and EPS. 
Holy shit $tsla 😵 
Tesla up $100. Good way to start lucky 22. $tsla 
$TSLA up to $1160… insane strength to start the day

NEWS: RBC Capital analyst Joseph Spak raised the price target on $TSLA to $1,005 (from $950) while maintaining a Sector Perform rating. 
$TSLA up nearly $100B on a production increase of 70K cars. 

Everyone already knew here was a backlog, so only production was the "surprise".

$140,000,000 per extra car produced.  What a time. 
Bought a few at $1137.47. $TSLA 
Going to be a fun day. 👀

$TSLA 🚀 
My revised $TSLA FY’21 Adj EPS is $6.80 (from $6.50) based on FY’21 delivs of 936K. My revised 4Q EPS is $2.55 (was $2.25). I will likely raise my FY’22 Vols (1,520K) and EPS ($12), but am so far ahead of WS already (1,310K and $8.90, respectively). WS is furiously revising ests. 
Day 1 hasn't even started and $TSLA is in its bag 👀 💰 https://t.co/d6T35p5blr 
Such a great day to start 2022, good morning $TSLA 🐮 🐮 🐮 https://t.co/MtkbXWq5jq 
You tryna trade $TSLA ?? 

Wait for consolidation. IV too damn high. Better risk reward is to the downside not upside anymore 
Just sold my Friday shares (1,000) I picked up for $1057. Sold at $1053 for a nice $96,000 win over the weekend. Still holding my 6,500 other shares. $TSLA 
$TSLA — insane action. Don’t get caught in traps, play it smart. 

Wait a few mins, let the stock gauge real direction and take the trade from there.

Also be on watch for a morning shakeout on the open if any weakness is present. 
$TSLA is up over 8% in premarket trading 
So basically like opening a store in Auschwitz. In 1942

TESLA INC SHARES UP 6.7% PREMARKET AFTER RECORD Q4 DELIVERIES
$TSLA 
3/ $TSLA likely to move to ATH (11/4 $1,230) between now and 4Q EPS (1/26E) as Austin/Berlin open, Elon overhang lifted, and investors pull forward 2023-2024 forecasts into 2022. 2022 delivs of 1.6M are realistic: 4Q run rate 1.2M, +150K China, and +150K each from Berlin/Austin. 
$TSLA will triple in 2022 🚀🌕 https://t.co/NdXkN7rbpO 
2/ $TSLA 4Q delivs of 308.6K shocked the Street. This morning, stunned analysts will leapfrog each other to boost 4Q EPS ests from $1.97 to &gt;$2.40, 2022 delivs ests from 1.3M to 1.5M (my est 1,520K), and 2022 EPS from $8.70 to $10+ (my est $12). Bulls will raise PTs to $1,600. https://t.co/QSFMCTv5aR 
$TSLA +7% to $1,130 pre-mkt after 4Q delivs of 308.6K crushed expectations. This will cause FY’22 Vol/EPS ests to soar 10-15%, as analyst expectations in 2023-2024 will now happen in 2022. Equities rallied behind TSLA (SPX +0.4% NDX +0.5%) as Omicron fears eased. 10yrTY closed. https://t.co/SSapwNVfa0

Best to ignore him and move on. Otherwise you give him a voice by acknowledging his foolishness. Take the fuel out of his fire. 
The best part about $TSLA being up 6%+ pre-market? Knowing $TSLAQ can't do a thing about their bag of puts until the market opens.

@Reed_Wolfpack Do spend some time researching companies you give an opinion on: @Tesla has their own approach to dealing with the chip crisis. They rewrite code to match other chips and they never cancelled their chip orders to begin with.

$TSLA price target raised from $250 to $295 at JPMorgan Chase 
2/As a former analyst, I’m perplexed that analysts will acknowledge a massive volume beat, and then fall back on a backward valuation argument that’s not relevant with volumes and earnings soaring at 80%. I haven’t seen anything from bears that’s substantive. Emotion rules. $tsla https://t.co/z6zaeh9CY6 
$TSLA bears’ research rolling in: “4Q production and deliveries impressive…continued near-term stock appreciation likely.” And this silliness: “TSLA trades at &gt;$1M per car delivered”. That’s like looking at price to trailing earnings, which is irrelevant with soaring earnings.

Controversial opinion…⁉️

I think $TSLA will under react to the 309,000 deliveries news.

Outside of Tesla Twitter and YT communities, no retail nor many institutional investors have context for what 309,000 implies.

This may create opportunity for knowledgeable $TSLA bulls imo https://t.co/5c0XHPMijL
