Why matters.

It took Neel Kashkari (Fed's biggest dove and non-voter) with some asinine statements, $AAPL monster rally, pension rebalance, and month end markup to get that close. Tread cautious next week. 
The geniuses on TV who are gloating over Apple's performance today &amp; describing it as a "defensive play" will get a rude awakening. Ever heard of market mechanics, technicals &amp; psychology? Those were the reasons behind the rally, if anything the company is at peak earnings!
$AAPL 
My largest holdings are in $GOOG $FB $AAPL $MSFT $V $MA $CNSWF. I own many others and dabble here and there, but the majority of my holdings are in some of the best businesses in the world. Sit back and let them go to work. 
$AAPL finishes up 6.98% to $170.33 
Apple $AAPL could acquire both Peloton $PTON and Robinhood $HOOD in cash and would still have something like $170B of cash left on its balance sheet 
$AAPL at the highs, trading near $170 
QQQ on its way to 2nd best day of 2022 (+0.8%) as falling 10yr TY (1.775% -2.5b) and a solid beat by $AAPL lifted NDX. Russia remains wildcard going into the weekend, with possible bank sanctions the main deterrent against invading Ukraine. Next wk: GOOG, FB, AMZN, SBX, PYPL EPS. https://t.co/4UPKvMEJWk 
Safe to say Apple $AAPL had a good 2021 üçè https://t.co/NQQRKLedlk 
@EmmetPeppers @elonmusk Elon didn‚Äôt provide an EV product roadmap and instead focused on Tesla robots and robotaxis, which are a small part of $TSLA value. Imagine $AAPL doing a conference call, not talking about iPhones iPads or Macs and instead focusing on AAPL robots and driverless cars.

We dropped our sell rating on $AAPL this morning. iPhone demand flying well over what we expected, breaking replacement dynamics we observed in the last 10 years. Consumer demand for high-end electronics remains insane. Too bad, we won't have an opportunity to buy a dip!

We are not the same 
We don‚Äôt bet against $AAPL. It‚Äôs the one stock I will never short, no matter which direction the wind is blowing. 
A sign of supply-chain issues easing? Per $AAPL, they ‚Äústill expect significant supply constraints but less than we‚Äôve seen in Dec.‚Äù Good. BUT, Apple‚Äôs the most valuable co w/ strongest negotiating power. Their chip supplier ST Micro says it‚Äôll take to 2023 to see improvement. https://t.co/nn4vEik3Ti https://t.co/7Ig0yetUyB 
Forget about what $AAPL or $TSLA was 10 years ago because you didn‚Äôt buy it!

There are many great opportunities today that will be the next $TSLA or $AAPL in the next 10 years or so.

Start investing now, start building something for the next 10 years+

What are you buying?

$AAPL price target raised from $200 to $210 at Morgan Stanley 
If I would have invested $1,000 into $AAPL in January 1998, I‚Äôd have $1,440,000 today.

But I wasn‚Äôt even born yet so I couldn‚Äôt have done that. 

Damn. 
I swear this $44b in quarterly fcf from $aapl is mostly driven by these 99 cent monthly storage fees I get billed to my card that nobody likely cancels 
I've already said this.
 Right now I think it's still a trading market.
 But some time this year it's going to be a Buy and hold market again.
 And when that day comes.
 You want to buy $AAPL and $MSFT first and just put them away for life. 
$NIO $TSLA $AAPL it sucks for me because I have no funds to buy more. Owning a seasonal business has it‚Äôs pros and cons. 3 month winter break but no pay checks. Back to work March 21st. 16 years in business.

Textbook trap for #ES_F following AAPL earnings with bounce then drop, but since Mon ES stuck on repeat, making the trip between 4280 and 4420 *4x*. Coiling for massive move

Incredible to see that #Robinhood hit $85 after its #IPO in the insanity of #wallstreetbets. 6 months later it is trading at $9.99. A lot of new investors getting the lessons the previous investor generation learned in 2008-09 and 1999-2000. $HOOD #TSLA $GME $AMC $AAPL

$TSLA +1.7% to $843 pre-mkt after $AAPL DQ Revs beat ests (+4.7% pre-mkt). Equities higher (SPX +0.3% NDX +0.8%). 10yr TY +2.9bp to 1.828%. Market likely to view TSLA as now too cheap at 43x(!) 2023 EPS with 50%+ vol growth as EV adoption soars from 6.3% in 2021 to 30% by 2025. https://t.co/Ln13jrrUCo 
I am trying to comprehend $AAPL numbers.

$124 billion of revenue in a quarter!
Even if I assume $ 799 as avg. price of each unit sold (US price of iPhone 13 Pro), that's 15.6 crore units sold in a quarter üí•

In a jittery market with Fed talk everywhere, the tech space needed fundamental confidence from earnings season. We heard it from stalwarts MSFT and now AAPL, two major data points which speak to our view heading into this week.  We believe tech space way oversold on rate fears.
